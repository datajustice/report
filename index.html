          <p>Since the City of Detroit launched the <a href="https://data.detroitmi.gov/about">Open Data Portal and GO DATA policy initiative</a> in 2015, the <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/ddjc">Detroit Digital Justice Coalition (DDJC)</a> and <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/dctp">Detroit Community Technology Project (DCTP)</a> have been exploring ideas and practices that promote <em>data justice</em>. By data justice, we mean accountable and ethical uses of public data for social good that actively resist the criminalization and surveillance of poor people, people of color and other targeted communities.</p>
          <p>In order to understand what data justice could look like in practice for the City of Detroit, we asked a broad spectrum of Detroit residents to consider the potential benefits and potential harms of various data sets currently available on the <a href="http://data.detroitmi.gov">City's Open Data Portal</a>. From there, we assessed what actions can be taken by the city to maximize benefits and minimize harms. These recommendations are the result of the research we conducted.</p>
          <p>We present these recommendations for data justice to advocate for the adoption and implementation of community-generated policy provisions and to outline strategies for open data stewardship that focus on access, engagement and accountability.</p>

            <p>In order to build awareness and open data literacy in Detroit, it is important to consider digital inequality and limited access to broadband internet. Through our data justice surveys, we found that most residents first learn about open data and the portal at events or workshops, but these can be infrequent and hard to access. In addition to the online tutorials DoIT currently offers for learning about the portal, we need an engagement plan that emphasizes community dialogue and in-person training sessions. We are sharing strategies we have found successful through organizing Data DiscoTechs, like partnering with local recreation centers and developing popular education methods to interactively learn about open data, as a starting point.</p>

            <div class="back">
              <p>Currently, two key ways exist for residents to request public records not yet published to the portal: through the data portal’s nomination form and through Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) requests. The first option requires internet access and appears to be a slow process, as only a single nomination from over 30 suggestions has been approved since launching. The second option, FoIAs, are also notoriously cumbersome and can be costly. Yet, these two mediums remain crucial ways for the City to gauge community interest and data needs. FoIA requests and their responses, as well as approved nominated datasets, should be posted to the portal, to both boost relevant datasets for users and save internal resources in answering duplicate requests. We outlined our favorite ways that other cities are accomplishing this in our policy research.</p>

              <p>While we appreciate all open data, many datasets are not so easy to decipher. Participants in our data justice focus group often pointed to an example of confusing language in the Blight Violations dataset. How can we begin to use or analyze this dataset if we do not know how the City defines “blight”? Why is the definition not included with the description of the dataset? All datasets published to the Portal should include field definitions, data collection methods and basic definitions of policy-specific or technical language. The DPD: Citizen Complaints dataset exemplifies useful, thorough documentation and includes a description, contact information and field definitions, yet we have found many other datasets in Detroit’s portal to be lacking these metadata.</p>

            <div class="back">
              <p>The stated mission of the portal is, “to increase public access to valuable data and information concerning City government operations and service delivery.” But, what about crucial City operations and services that are now administered by government contractors, private corporations and quasi-public entities, like the Public Lighting Authority, Great Lakes Water Authority or Detroit Economic Growth Corporation? These entities are responsible for datasets that we found community organizers often cite as most important to have access to, such as utility shut-offs and development projects, yet are not subject to FoIA laws. The portal should include basic contract information about all service providers at minimum, and ideally additional data about their specific operating activities. For example, what vendor(s) does the City contract to remove garbage? Where is that vendor located, what is the timeline and total amount of their contract? The Sunlight Foundation offers legal language for a provision like this to ensure “government decisions to employ outside contractors do not result in the public losing access to its own information.”</p>

            <div class="back">
              <p>While open data positively boosts government transparency, it can also be a source of fear, paranoia and harm to residents. While facilitating data justice scenarios, we heard deep-rooted concerns about how crime data can re-victimize survivors of assault, how the Improve Detroit Open Issues queue can incite property swindles (like a metal scrapper pinpointing an abandoned vehicle), how Blight Tickets can reinforce “bad” and “undesirable” neighborhood reputations and influence property values or red-lining practices, or how a randomized block-level location of a Crime Incident is not random enough in Detroit’s most desolate areas to truly protect victims from stigmatization or further harassment. As the City continues to publish data, it is crucial to both offer clear documentation for data processing methods as they relate to information privacy and establish a process for residents to ask questions, voice concerns and file disputes.</p>

              <p>While it is simple to see how the Portal has grown since its launch through the Public Dataset Inventory, we also want to know what is coming next so that we can plan community research and organizing initiatives. Once or twice a year, DoIT should publish their key goals and activities, sharing with the public which dataset releases, portal feature improvements and public events to anticipate. Similar to the NYC Open Data Portal, the front page of Detroit’s portal should highlight available features, identify the purpose, advertise new releases and offer quick links to things that matter most to Detroiters.</p>

        <h2>Research & Resources</h2>
        <p>Alongside these recommendations, we're also eager to share our findings from multiple participatory research projects initiated by the DDJC and DCTP as well as community education resources for adapting our strategies for exploring issues related to data justice.</p>
        <h2>Connect with us!</h2>
        <p>We expect that our recommendations, and the research that has shaped them, will continue to evolve as we continue organzing around data justice.</p>
