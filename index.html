<h1>Data Justice</h1>
<p>(Homepage in progress. Introduce report, research and resources available on this site and how to contribute. Other key info to include here?)</p>
<h2>Our work</h2>
<p>Since the City of Detroit launched the Open Data Portal and GO DATA policy initiative in 2015, the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition (DDJC) and Detroit Community Technology Project (DCTP) have been exploring ideas and practices that promote data justice. By data justice, we mean understanding the ways in which open data can be both beneficial and harmful to residents, especially to communities that have been historically criminalized.</p>
<p>This report - Recommendations for Data Justice - is the product of our organizing efforts, participatory research projects and community education initiatives around open data. We present these recommendations to advocate for the adoption and implementation of community-generated policy provisions and to outline strategies for open data stewardship that focus on access, engagement and accountability. Alongside our recommendations, we also share key takeaways from our research and resources for adapting our strategies.</p>
<h2>Connect with us</h2>
<p>We expect that our recommendations, and the research that has shaped them, will continue to grow and evolve as we move forward with our data justice work. We welcome feedback and your ideas at communitytechnology@alliedmedia.org.</p>
<p>We also welcome contributions, especially to our Resources page. Share links to projects, popular education tools and curriculum for learning about open data, and more by submitting an issue or pull request to our Github repository (requires a Github account) or by email.</p>
