<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Our recommendations for data justice presented above are the outcome of multiple participatory research projects and community education initiatives facilitated by the DDJC and DCTP around open data since early 2015.</p>
<p>We have collaboratively identified the following questions to guide and motivate our research:
<ul>
	<li>What should Detroit residents be aware of when it comes to open data?</li>
	<li>What are the perceived benefits and harms of open data to residents?</li>
	<li>How can we inform all residents and educate our communities about open data?</li>
	<li>What can we learn from other cities? What types of open data policies, portals and practices do they have in place?</li>
	<li>What does participatory and democratic governance of open data look like, and how can we help to facilitate it here in Detroit?</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Below are summaries from our four key research projects, with links to follow to read more about our full methods and findings. Each research project has led us to understand the concept of data justice more deeply and shaped our recommendations.</p>
<p>(Research in progress. Below are placeholders for modules/boxes/buttons/images that will represent four research areas.)</p>
<div class="research-module">
	<p>The Data Justice Survey was created by members of the DDJC and is available to Data DiscoTech participants. The survey gauges familiarity with government data, perceptions of how open data is collected and used, and which data sets are most important for our communities to have access to.</p>

	<p>Data Justice Scenarios are a collective brainstorming exercise facilitated through focus groups. Together, participants learn about a specific dataset, raise questions about how it is initially collected, and craft possible positive and negative use case scenarios of that data, with the goal of identifying actions and policies to maximize benefits and reduce harms.</p>

	<p>Research into open data policies, portals and practices has been completed by members of the DDJC and compares and contrasts what open data looks like and how it works across different U.S. cities, aiming to understand how data policy shapes data culture and highlight creative, just uses cases of open data.</p>

	<p>Data DiscoTechs, or <em>discovering technology</em> fairs, are interactive workshops designed to demystify, engage and inform participants about the impact and possibilities of open data within our communities.</p>
