        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>Our recommendations for data justice presented above are the outcome of multiple participatory research projects and community education initiatives facilitated by the DDJC and DCTP around open data since early 2015.</p>
        <p>We have collaboratively identified the following questions to guide and motivate our research:
        <ul>
	       <li>What should Detroit residents be aware of when it comes to open data?</li>
	       <li>What are the perceived benefits and harms of open data to residents?</li>
	       <li>How can we inform all residents and educate our communities about open data?</li>
	       <li>What can we learn from other cities? What types of open data policies, portals and practices do they have in place?</li>
	       <li>What does participatory and democratic governance of open data look like, and how can we help to facilitate it here in Detroit?</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Below are summaries from our four key research projects, with links to follow to read more about our full methods and findings. Each research project has led us to understand the concept of data justice more deeply and shaped our recommendations.</p>

        		<p>The Data Justice Survey was created by members of the DDJC and is available to Data DiscoTech participants. The survey gauges        familiarity with 	government data, perceptions of how open data is collected and used, and which data sets are most important for our       communities to have access to.</p>

        		<p>Data Justice Scenarios are a collective brainstorming exercise facilitated through focus groups. Together, participants learn about a        specific 	dataset, raise questions about how it is initially collected, and craft possible positive and negative use case scenarios of        that data, with the goal 	of identifying actions and policies to maximize benefits and reduce harms.</p>

        		<p>Research into open data policies, portals and practices has been completed by members of the DDJC and compares and contrasts what open         data looks 	like and how it works across different U.S. cities, aiming to understand how data policy shapes data culture and highlight        creative, just uses cases 	of open data.</p>
