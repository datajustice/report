	 	     <li><h2><a id="engage">Engage residents offline about open data</a></h2>
	 	     <p>In order to build awareness and open data literacy in Detroit, it is important to consider    igital   inequality and limited access to broadband internet. Through our data justice surveys, we    ound that  most residents first learn about open data and the portal at events or workshops, but    hese can be   infrequent and hard to access. In addition to the online tutorials DoIT currently     ffers for learning   about the portal, we need an engagement plan that emphasizes community dialogue    nd in-person training  sessions. We are sharing strategies we have found successful through    rganizing Data DiscoTechs, like  partnering with local recreation centers and developing popular    ducation methods to interactively   learn about open data, as a starting point.</p>
	       </li>
         <li><h2><a id="prioritize">Prioritize the release of new datasets based on community interest</a></h2>
	       <p>Currently, two key ways exist for residents to request public records not yet published to the  portal: through the data portal’s nomination form and through Freedom of Information Act (FoIA)  requests. The first option requires internet access and appears to be a slow process, as only a single   nomination from over 30 suggestions has been approved since launching. The second option, FoIAs, are  also notoriously cumbersome and can be costly. Yet, these two mediums remain crucial ways for the City   to gauge community interest and data needs. FoIA requests and their responses, as well as approved  nominated datasets, should be posted to the portal, to both boost relevant datasets for users and save   internal resources in answering duplicate requests. We outlined our favorite ways that other cities   are accomplishing this in our policy research.</p>
	       </li>
	       <li><h2><a id="define">Define technical terms</a></h2>
	       <p>While we appreciate all open data, many datasets are not so easy to decipher. Participants in our   data justice focus group often pointed to an example of confusing language in the Blight Violations   dataset. How can we begin to use or analyze this dataset if we do not know how the City defines   “blight”? Why is the definition not included with the description of the dataset? All datasets  published to the Portal should include field definitions, data collection methods and basic  descriptions of policy-specific or technical language. The DPD: Citizen Complaints dataset exemplifies   useful, thorough documentation and includes a description, contact information and field definitions,   yet we have found many other datasets in Detroit’s portal to be lacking these metadata.</p>
	       </li>
	       <li><h2><a id="services">Make data about all city services available, even for privatized public   services</a></h2>
	       <p>The stated mission of the portal is, “to increase public access to valuable data and information  concerning City government operations and service delivery.” But, what about crucial City operations   and services that are now administered by government contractors, private corporations and  quasi-public entities, like the Public Lighting Authority, Great Lakes Water Authority or Detroit  Economic Growth Corporation? These entities are responsible for datasets that we found community   organizers often cite as most important to have access to, such as utility shut-offs and development  projects, yet are not subject to FoIA laws. The portal should include basic contract information about   all service providers at minimum, and ideally additional data about their specific operating  activities. For example, what vendor(s) does the City contract to remove garbage? Where is that vendor   located, what is the timeline and total amount of their contract? The Sunlight Foundation offers legal  language for a provision like this to ensure “government decisions to employ outside contractors do  not result in the public losing access to its own information.”</p>
	       </li>
	       <li><h2><a id="protect">Protect the people represented by the numbers</a></h2>
	       <p>While open data positively boosts government transparency, it can also be a source of fear,   paranoia and harm to residents. While facilitating data justice scenarios, we heard deep-rooted   concerns about how crime data can re-victimize survivors of assault, how the Improve Detroit Open   Issues queue can incite property swindles (like a metal scrapper pinpointing an abandoned vehicle),   how Blight Tickets can reinforce “bad” and “undesirable” neighborhood reputations and influence   property values or red-lining practices, or how a randomized block-level location of a Crime Incident   is not random enough in Detroit’s most desolate areas to truly protect victims from stigmatization or   further harassment. As the City continues to publish data, it is crucial to both offer clear  documentation for data processing methods as they relate to information privacy and establish a  process for residents to ask questions, voice concerns and file disputes.</p>
	       </li>
	       <li><h2><a id="future">Share what's coming next</a></h2>
	       <p>While it is simple to see how the Portal has grown since its launch through the Public Dataset  Inventory, we also want to know what is coming next so that we can plan community research and   organizing initiatives. Once or twice a year, DoIT should publish their key goals and activities,   sharing with the public which dataset releases, portal feature improvements and public events to  anticipate. Similar to the NYC Open Data Portal, the front page of Detroit’s portal should highlight   available features, identify the purpose, advertise new releases and offer quick links to things that   matter most to Detroiters.</p>
