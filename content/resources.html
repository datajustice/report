<p>For more on open data, check out these resources:
<ul>
	<li>Opening Data zine. Compiled by the DDJC and DCTP in 2015, the zine includes a primer on open data, real-world examples of data discrimination, use cases of data in organizing, creative data storytelling, and many links to follow for local projects.</li>
	<li>Data DiscoTech model. Through photos and videos, see what happens at a Data DiscoTech from the perspectives of participants and station managers.</li>
	<li>Open Data Policy Guidelines. Presented by the Sunlight Foundation, a national nonprofit dedicated to government transparency and accountability, these guidelines offer in-depth, technical ideas and language for comprehensive open data policy and are foundational to the locally-rooted recommendations weâ€™ve presented above.</li>
