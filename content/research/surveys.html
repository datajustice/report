        <div class="h1-graphic"></div>
          <p>The Data Justice Survey is available to participants at each Data Discotech and serves as a tool to gauge familiarity with government data, perceptions of how open data is collected and used, and which data sets are most important for our communities to have access to.</p> 
          <p>Until now, survey answers have only been used by the DDJC to identify ways to make upcoming Data Discotech station content more relevant and meaningful. Our findings are now being shared in full below to offer a deeper understanding of open data in Detroit.</p>

          <p><strong>79.5% of respondents had heard of the City of Detroit's Open Data Portal</p>
          <p>51.5% of those cite a “Data Discotech”, “DDJC” or “AMP” as their first source of information.</strong></p>
           <p>In order to find out how to raise awareness of open data in Detroit, we asked, “which tactic do you think would be MOST effective at informing Detroiters about the portal and getting them to use it?” Most participants answered “free 101 trainings for the general public at libraries or community centers” and “advanced trainings in how to use and analyze the data for community leaders.”</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 1px"> This information ranged from providing a social security number or bank account over email to questions about gender, marital status, income, criminal or arrest history, mental health and medical information.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="3a">
          <p>Section two of the survey asks participants to rate on a scale of 1-5 whether a dataset “should be shared widely without restrictions” (1) or “should not even be collected, much less shared” (5).</p>
          <p>Participants think that the following datasets should be most widely shared:
          <ul>
            <li>“Locations of working and non-working streetlights”</li>
            <li>“Locations of stores that accept EBT cards”</li>
            <li>“Mayor's travel budget and schedule”</li>
            <li>“Names of donors to political candidates and campaigns”</li>
            <li>“Number and location of police brutality complaints”</li>
            <li>“Unedited police car dashboard camera footage”</li>
            <li>“Number of utility shut-offs at the block level”</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>In contrast, participants ranked only a few datasets at the opposite end of the scale, as ones that should not be collected or shared:
          <ul>
            <li>“Names of anonymous informants to Child Protective Services”</li>
            <li>“Types of food purchased with SNAP benefits”</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>A number of datasets were also ranked in the middle, as respondents were undecided at what level the data should be shared and concerned about privacy and protecting anonymity:
          <ul>
            <li>“Utility shut-off status at address (house or building) level”</li>
            <li>“Locations of houses entering foreclosure”</li>
            <li>“Locations of clusters of highly communicable diseases, i.e. tuberculosis or HIV”</li>
            <li>“Addresses where domestic violence complaints reported to DPD occurred”</li>
          </ul></p>
          <div class="chart" id="sharable-container"></div>
        </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="4a">
          <p>In the third section of the survey, participants were presented with a list of all datasets currently available on the City of Detroit’s portal and asked which data had the potential to be most useful or most harmful to themselves, their family or community.</p>
          <p>Through open-ended responses, many participants said that basically every dataset on the list could likely provide some value. To explain their choices, they offered anecdotes like:
          <ul>
            <li>“I'm seeking to move back in the City of Detroit, so housing parcels, neighborhood conditions, and safety are important to determine where to live”</li>
            <li>“People who don't have a car need to know where they can catch a bus”</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>Other respondents spoke to how different datasets are specifically meaningful to community organizers because they can “help organizers make better, informed decisions about how to confront local issues” and noted that data also have the power to “be helpful at the neighborhood level, diverting [perceptions of issues] from individual to systemic problems.”</p>
          <p>On the flip side, most participants noted that the following data topics have potential to be harmful: foreclosure data; property purchaser and ownership information, moreso about individual than company ownership; and the locations of any victims of a crime, especially for domestic violence incidents.</p>
          <p>Respondents expanded their answers and said they fear that these data could:
          <ul>
            <li>“Be manipulated to make certain areas appear more dangerous and preclude development there” and “give neighborhoods a bad reputation”</li>
            <li>“Lead to insurance red-lining” and “discriminate against families and neighborhoods”</li>
            <li>“Harm, embarrass, re-victimize or stigmatize victims of domestic violence”</li>
            <li>“Lead to more policing”</li>
            <li>“Put undocumented people in danger”</li>
          </ul></p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="5a">
          <p>Lastly, participants were asked to list any datasets that they would like added to the portal. Popular responses included: 
          <ul>
            <li>“Charter school data - who has the charter, their status, how many charters, how much funding”</li>
            <li>“Data on utilities - running water problems after housing demolitions, who are the contractors turning off water?”</li>
            <li>“All contracts past and present and bid open - include terms of contract with timing and area of effect. What performance measures and measures of satisfaction exist?”</li>
            <li>“Frequency of buses, map transportation earliest and latest run times, grocery and hardware stores (by depth of product) include services such as ride home and day care”</li>
            <li>“Government accountability - police activities, police brutality, political campaign info/spending” and “city council minutes”</li>
            <li>“Information on pollution, air and water quality are important”</li>
          </ul></p>
