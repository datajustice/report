<h1>Research: Data Justice Surveys</h1>
<p>The Data Justice Survey is available to participants at each Data Discotech and serves as a tool to gauge familiarity with government data, perceptions of how open data is collected and used, and which data sets are most important for our communities to have access to.</p> 
<p>The survey includes 33 questions, split between four sections that include first impressions of open data, how data is used, potential datasets, and personal contact information. All responses are optional.</p>
<p>39 people have responded to the Data Justice Survey as of November 2016, and our respondents represent Data Discotech attendees between September 2015 and October 2016. These attendees are primarily Detroit residents who live in or have a connection to the District where the Data Discotech is hosted.</p>
<p>So far, Data Discotech’s have been held in: District 4 at the Samaritan Center in Sept. 2015; District 6 at Grace in Action in April 2016); District 3 at the Boggs School in June 2016; and, in District 7 at the Butzel Community Center in Oct. 2016. Data Discotechs hope to travel to the remaining Districts throughout 2016-2017, continuing to offer this survey and building a more geographically-inclusive sample of respondents.</p>
<p>Until now, survey answers have only been used by the DDJC to identify ways to make upcoming Data Discotech station content more relevant and meaningful. Our findings are now being shared in full below to offer a deeper understanding of open data in Detroit.</p>
<h2>Our findings</h2>
<p>The first section of the survey asks participants if they’ve heard about the City of Detroit’s Open Data Portal and where they heard about it for the first time. 79.5% say that they have heard of the portal, and 51.5% of those cite a “Data Discotech”, “DDJC” or “AMP” as their first source of information.</p> 
<p>50% of respondents say they’ve been asked by a government agency to provide personal data they did not feel comfortable sharing, ranging from providing a social security number or bank account over email to questions about gender, marital status, income, criminal or arrest history, mental health and medical information. 37% have experienced a government agency collecting or sharing their information without consent.</p>
<p>In order to find out how to raise awareness of open data in Detroit, we asked, “which tactic do you think would be MOST effective at informing Detroiters about the portal and getting them to use it?” Most participants answered “free 101 trainings for the general public at libraries or community centers” and “advanced trainings in how to use and analyze the data for community leaders.”</p>
