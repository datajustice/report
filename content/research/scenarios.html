<h1>Research: Data Justice Scenarios</h1>
<p>To understand how different datasets can be both beneficial and harmful to Detroit residents, we facilitated multiple focus groups to brainstorm use cases of different types of data and craft scenarios. These scenarios capture the perspectives of community organizers, homeowners, business owners, parents, artists and long-time residents of Detroit and offer specific ideas for promoting ethical uses of data.</p>
<p>Four focus groups were facilitated over two months in the fall of 2016, drawing approximately thirty participants total. The first two focus groups lasted between 30-90 minutes and mostly included members of the DDJC and DCTP, and all participants were aware of Detroit’s Open Data Portal prior to the exercises. The third and largest focus group lasted two hours and participants represented a broad network of community organizers invited by members of the DDJC, and only a small handful were familiar with open data initiatives or the data portal to begin. Data scenario exercises were facilitated for a fourth time at the October 2016 Data Discotech hosted at Butzel Community Center.</p>
<p>To craft each scenario, we introduced a single dataset offered through Detroit’s Open Data Portal. We chose datasets based on two criteria: that the dataset is considered one the “most accessed” by users; and, that it has a “Data Lens” view, a built-in feature from Socrata, the technology provider of Detroit’s data portal, that helpfully provides internal tools for charting, mapping and filtering a dataset without having to download it yourself. This was particularly useful for quickly and effectively introducing datasets to new users within the time constraints of the focus groups.</p>
<p>All exercises involved a mix of silent write and group discussion, and prompted participants to examine the dataset presented and reflect on the following four key questions:
<ul>
	<li>Is this data neutral to begin? Is it clear how it is defined, collected or updated?</li>
	<li>How could these data be used in beneficial ways to you or your communities?</li>
	<li>How could these data be used in harmful ways to you or your communities?</li>
	<li>What actions should be taken to maximize benefits and reduce harms? Whose responsibility are those actions (the community, the city, etc)?</li>
</ul></p>
<p>We used participant feedback to refine our prompts and facilitation methods between each session, learning to better manage our time and help draw the most concise ideas.</p>
<h2>The scenarios</h2>
<p>We created data justice scenarios for seven datasets in all over the four sessions of focus groups. Below, in no particular order, we share our perceived benefits and harms of each dataset covered, as well as any initial questions raised by participants about how that data is collected, maintained or updated by the City. Afterwards, we discuss common reflections among all the datasets about what actions could maximize the beneficial uses of these data.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>After generating these data justice scenarios about the perceived benefits and harms of multiple datasets and topics, we further prompted participants to re-examine these lists and extract specific actions that might be taken to maximize benefits and reduce harms. In many cases, participants identified similar actions despite the various topics and types of data.</p>
<p>Common actions to maximize benefits often fell in two categories: first, to improve language provided directly through the portal, making the data more usable to those with less technical or policy expertise; and second, to initiate community-based research projects with the goal of highlighting discrepancies in City service delivery or code enforcement. Conducting research to investigate inconsistencies in open data is an especially important action to ensure that open data does not reinforce bad reputations or false impressions of certain Detroit neighborhoods, for fear of further justifying divestment and discrimination.</p>
<p>Of these actions identified by our focus group participants, the first falls to the responsibility of the City to provide more thorough documentation, engagement and training, the second calls on organizers and community-based data practitioners to mobilize around some of these big research questions that can be answered through open data.</p>
<p>As we continue working on data justice initiatives through the DDJC and DCTP, we hope to continue facilitating these scenarios to more deeply understand the perceived positive and negative impacts of open data to our communities and eventually tackle some of the research questions that arise from them.</p>
