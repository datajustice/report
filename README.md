# Data Justice Report
This repository shares Recommendations for Equitable Open Data, a report released by the <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/ddjc">Detroit Digital Justice Coaliton</a> and <a href="https://www.alliedmedia.org/dctp">Detroit Community Technology Project</a> in Winter 2017. 

We're hosting our report, and the research projects that shaped it, here on Github because it's a collaborative space where we hope others can easily contribute further ideas and resources around data justice, inspired by the <a href="https://communitytechnology.github.io/">Community Technology Field Guide</a>.
