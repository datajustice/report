# Data Justice Report

This repository shares Recommendations for Equitable Open Data created by the Detroit Digital Justice Coaliton and Detroit Community Technology Project in Winter 2017. We're hosting a digital version of our report here on Github because it's a collaborative space where others can contribute ideas and resources around data justice, inspired by the Field Guide to Community Technology.
